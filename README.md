# walksignal
walksignal is a set of tools to plot OpenCellID data on street maps and other
images. The project was originally motivated by interest in comparing
real-world data to random walk models in the context of signal reception and
quality. It relies heavily on the use of freely-available mobile apps and
online services:

1. [Network Cell Info Lite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wilysis.cellinfolite&hl=en_CA&gl=US)
2. [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)
3. [OpenCellID](https://www.opencellid.org)

GUI:

## Usage

### Basic Data Requirements

Although example data can be found in the data/ subfolder, the tools here are
designed to work with other datasets. In order to compile a dataset for use,
the following things are required:

1. At least one set of OpenCellID data, such as that exported by the Network
   Cell Info Lite app
2. A map image exported from the OpenStreetMap site, which contains the area of
   interest (if plotting spatial data such as in the example)
3. A map boundary box, defined as min/max lat/long readings, defined in the
   same path as the map file and the data as "bbox.txt". This can be
   obtained on the same page as the export of the map image

### Using gws

Run the following to start the GUI:
`./gws`

The plot tab and map tab are both updated when selecting the "Load Tower
Data" button.
